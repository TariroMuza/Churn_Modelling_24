# Churn_Modelling_24: Customer Churn Analysis

This is the capstone project for a Data Science Certificate Program. The project focuses on analyzing a customer churn dataset using data analysis and visualization techniques, without building predictive models.

# Project Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Analyze and visualize categorical and numerical features
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Apply transformations and encoding
- Compute correlations and apply feature selection

# Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

# Project overview and instructions : Key Steps Performed

1. Data Inspection
   - Analyzed data types
   - Handled missing values in the 'Tenure' column

2. Data Cleaning
   - Removed duplicates
   - Treated outliers with statistical methods and visualizations

3. Visualization
   - Countplots for categorical variables
   - Histograms for numerical variables
   - Jointplots and scatter plots for feature interactions

4. Feature Engineering
   - Encoded categorical features
   - Applied scaling to numerical features

5. Correlation & Feature Selection
   - Heatmap and correlation matrix
   - SelectKBest to identify top 5 features for potential model input
